## Arduino Sumo Bot 🤖

### Overview 📖

Embark on an electrifying journey into the world of robotics with our Arduino Sumo Bot—a pulsating project ⚡️ born from the depths of a university course 🎓. Tailored for riveting Sumo battles, this bot seamlessly weaves together the threads of Arduino programming 💻, sophisticated sensor integration 📡, and laser-focused motor control 🕹️.

### Key Features ✨

* **Arduino-Powered:** Driven by an Arduino microcontroller 🧠, offering a malleable and programmable canvas for robotics enthusiasts.

* **Sensor Integration:** Armed with infrared sensors, our Sumo Bot deftly senses Sumo ring edges 📏 and strategically tracks its adversary .

* **Motor Control:** Revel in precise control over motors ⚙️, enabling nimble movements crucial for outmaneuvering opponents in Sumo battles 🔥🔥🔥.

### Getting Started 🚀

1. 🛠️ **Hardware Setup:** Dive into detailed instructions for assembling the necessary components.
2. 💻 **Codebase:** Immerse yourself in the Arduino code directing the Sumo Bot's evasive maneuvers and tactical decision-making.
3. 📘 **Documentation:** Uncover the mysteries with a comprehensive guide, unveiling the project's structure, functionality, and customization options.

### Competition Rules

* **Hardware:**

    * Maximum of two motors for movement ⚙️
    * Any sensors allowed 
    * No height or weight limit 
    * Recommended chassis: Teacher's recommendation or the closest alternative chassis
    * Budget: Around $50 💵💵💵

* **Ring Size:** 0.6 meters in surface

* **Out of Bounds:** A robot is considered out of the ring if any part of its body touches the ground outside of the ring

* **Winning Condition:** First robot to force the opponent robot out of the ring wins the match 

### Scoring 🏆🏆🏆

* **Full Win:** 2 points for forcing the opponent robot out of the ring 🏆🏆

* **Early Win:** 1 point 🏆 for kicking the opponent robot out of the ring within the first 30 seconds. The match resumes.

### Safety 🛡️🛡️🛡️

* **Safe Design:** All robots must be designed and operated in a safe manner.

* **No Weapons:** Robots must not be equipped with any weapons or other devices that could harm other robots or spectators 🚫🚫🚫.
